Ever find yourself writing a little code and you need to test the configurations needed to make a request to something and get the response to understand how to handle it?
Do you use VSCode?
If you said yes to both these questions, check this out!

1. Open VSCode and navigate to the extension library

2. Locate the extension "REST Client" by Huachao Mao and install it

3. This extension will give you the power to make API calls directly from the IDE without having to leave the application

4. Create a file to type in your request
Example:
GET https://bombsat69.usersys.redhat.com/api/hosts/3/
Authorization: Basic admin:redhat

5. Once you have your request, locate the "Send Requst" button at the top of the file right below the file name, and click it.

6. The screen will split and the new section will now include all headers used in the request along with the output returned from the request.
