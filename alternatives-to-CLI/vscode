Ever find yourself writing a little code and you need to test the configurations needed to make a request to something and get the response to understand how to handle it?
Do you use VSCode?
If you said yes to both these questions, check this out!

1. Open VSCode and navigate to the extension library

2. Locate the extension "REST Client" by Huachao Mao and install it

3. This extension will give you the power to make API calls directly from the IDE without having to leave the application

4. Create a file to type in your request
Example:
GET https://bombsat69.usersys.redhat.com/api/hosts/3/
Authorization: Basic admin:redhat

5. Once you have your request, locate the "Send Requst" button at the top of the file right below the file name, and click it.

6. The screen will split and the new section will now include all headers used in the request along with the output returned from the request. 





















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































BONUS ROUND!
You found me! So I guess I'll throw you an additional demo.

Ever find yourself working a case or talking with a customer and you have to schedule something with them? You then find that they aren't in the same timezone as you and you now have to rely on the results of your google skills and math to convert your timezone to theirs to confirm a date and time. If only there was an easier way to understand what time it was at the customer location, what the gmt offset is, or just what time would a certain time be for that location!
Wish Granted!

Go here and get yourself a free API key:
https://www.abstractapi.com/time-date-timezone-api

Then use the api key in your API calls to perform various timezone conversions. 
Check out the docs here:
https://app.abstractapi.com/api/timezone/documentation


Example 1:
What timezone is Seattle, Washington and what time is it there?
# curl --request GET --url 'https://timezone.abstractapi.com/v1/current_time?api_key=abc123&location=Seattle%2C%20Washington'

or for VSCode:
GET https://timezone.abstractapi.com/v1/current_time?api_key=abc123
&location=Seattle, Washington


Example 2:
I can join the custy on a remote session at 3pm today. What time would that be for them in Moscow, Russia?
# curl --request GET --url 'https://timezone.abstractapi.com/v1/convert_time/?api_key=abc123&base_location=Raleigh%2C%20NC&base_datetime=2021-09-22%2001%3A00&target_location=Moscow%2C%20Russia' | jq -r .target_location.datetime

or for VSCode:
GET https://timezone.abstractapi.com/v1/convert_time/?api_key=abc123
&base_location=Raleigh, NC
&base_datetime=2021-09-22 01:00
&target_location=Moscow, Russia
